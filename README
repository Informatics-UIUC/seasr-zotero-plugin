To release a new version to http://repository.seasr.org/Zotero/Releases

1. Create .xpi file
2. Copy file with proper name into .../Zotero/Releases/experimental/<version>/
3. Create a changelog XHTML file like the ones for the previous versions containing the list of changes
4. Edit the .../Zotero/Releases/update-experimental-pretty.rdf and add entries for the new version - do not forget to update the sha1: entry for the hash of the new .xpi file  (get that by invoking 'openssl sha1 <file>.xpi' at mac/linux command prompt)
5. Copy/overwrite the update-experimental.rdf file with the contents of update-experimental-pretty.rdf
6. Use the McCoy program to sign the update-experimental.rdf file (the McCoy program contains the private key used for signing .. only Boris has that now)
7. Test that the new release works properly by trying to use the "Check for updates" in Firefox to update an earlier version to the latest version you created

That's all, folks.
